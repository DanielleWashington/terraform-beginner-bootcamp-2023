    <title>Bossa Nova for the World!</title>
</head>

    <h1> What could be better than the smooth, elegant sounds of jazz blended with the quick, lively sounds of samba? </h1>
    <h2> Bossa Nova! </h2>
    <p> Bossa Nova, which literally translates to "new wave" is the love-child of the jazz and samba genres. 
        Born in the Copacabana section of Rio, Bossa Nova has enchanted the world with its infectious, easy-going sounds. 
        Many are enamored with classics like "The Girl from Ipanema," "Corcovado," and even "Desafinado" and if you haven't yet heard them, 
        do yourself that favor! </p>
